\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a better way to perform incremental redundancy this is RoXOR
    \item Codes should be designed to further match the channel characteristics.
    \item RoXOR's code describes the perfect balance between performance and complexity
    \item The mean delay performance is better than ZigZag
\end{enumerate}
